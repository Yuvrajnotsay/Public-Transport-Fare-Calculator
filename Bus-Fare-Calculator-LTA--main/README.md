# Bus-Fare-Calculator-LTA-
Calculates distance based fared based on distance travelled and bus-no

# Data Sources
1. https://www.mytransport.sg/content/mytransport/home/dataMall.html
2. https://data.gov.sg/dataset/fare-structure-mrts-and-lrts?resource_id=e496ae38-989e-4eac-977d-e64c9e91a20f

 # Futher Thoughts/Implementations:

* Create a chat bot to get fares

* Input bus-stop names instead of bus-stop codes since not many people use bus-stop codes

* Further analysis into shortest routes between 2 stops
